        I have never made a website before but I also haven't been doing any true coding in a long long time, so this is going to be a mess of a project history as I slowly cobble together the basics I need for a website and work from there.
    </br> </br>
        There is an excessive amount of deployments, unfortunately anything including images will not load on my local host to test before posting, so you are getting a full view of everything I try
    </br>
    </p>

<hr>
    <p>
        Eventually there will be a need for art assets to be uploaded, most of these will be made by me using either Clipstudio or Inkscape. Any exceptions will be listed here.

        The website is up! I'm able to put some simple text on the page that is reflected on the site proper. The next step is to make a more professional looking maintenance screen to a) look compentant and b) feed any users into an upcoming "Salesforce Digital Experience"       project I'll be working on as part of my portfolio. I created the background (/assets/background_site.png) as well as a clean version of the logo and and site icon in #aac6cb (/assets/logo.png and /assets/site icon 2.png) all three made in Inkscape so I can easily         test colours. 
    </br></br>
        I had a few tries using background_site.png as the site background but was facing some image loading issues on localhost, tried moving background_site.png to root but no dice, tried a smaller picture (/me.png) and still nothing, will return when I have time

        Hoping to start this project back up this week, realised I'd never checked the site itself after the push on 28/08, turns out the image upload works fine through GitHub pages! Progress will hopefully be made soon
    </br></br>
        I came back to this this evening, the background is now working and SHOULD be fixed, no scrolling,  a header logo has been added and favicon is working fine. I did try to add social links to the site, the links work, but I am currently struggling to make them sit          where I want them to but it is so very late so I will return next I have the time

        <b>09/09/25</b>
    </br>
        Tidied up the README.md somewhat, I was hoping to colour code some of the test to make a more clear breakdown of my journalling for my dyselxia (large blocks of white on black or vice versa can blur) but alas. This is at least more readable than before
    </br> </br>
        A lot of positional futzing was to be had today, but I've managed to get everything laid out where I relatively want it to be. The styles started to get a bit long so I've moved it into it's own seperate sheet, seems to be working without any additional changes.
    </br></br>
        For this first stage of project I will probably keep everything fixed as is (once the maintenance message is in) while I move onto a Salesforce project temporarily, adding in relevant links as they are created. But I'm excited to see how much of a challenge making        a flexi website is, I gave it a shot and somethings are in the right place but others have just straight vanished! Fun!
    </br></br>
        Unfortunately I cannot continue anymore today

       But there are also some more challenging goals I have that won't be touched until the far future  
    </br></br>
             <b>FUTURE VICKI PROBLEMS:</b>    </p>
                <ul>
                   <li><del>make site work flexibly on multiple screen sizes</del> kinda works - not happy with overly long or overly tall screens</li>
                   <li><del>how hard is it to setup sub pages for projects etc</del></li>
                   <li>how hard is it to make it compatible with a mobile site</li>
              </ul> 
    <p>
           I may return to these midway through the Salesforce Digital Experience if I want a Dark Souls esque break, but otherwise I should be happy to proceed soon!

        <b>21/02/2026</b>
    </br>
        It has been awhile, whilst I was building this site I was very lucky to be able to get a job back in November and my brain has been focussed on getting up to speed with everything to do 
        with the new job! How exciting.
    </br></br>
        This weekend I think I've finally reached a point in this new job where I think I can start looking back at this project and I'm while waiting for the Salesforce org to expire (i
        fucked up my auth and can't get back in right now) I figured I'd come back and try and box off some of my other tasks.
    </br></br>
        I figured out how to make the header work nicely - looking back I was trying to put the logo header inside the socials header but at the top so just a bunch of small mistakes that only needed me to take a step back to figure out. the footer I've decided to make smaller and managed to fix the formatting of those footer links.
    </br></br>
        haaving multiple pages on my site turns out was easier than I expected. Although no my site has subpages with .html in them and I'm not sure how to fix that, a future job I think - but at least the POC is up and running - this README.md is going to be kept on the site as I think I'm in a position where I can link the site itself on my LinkedIn, maybe thats a bad idea but hey. But a thought i'm having - is this all a bit too grey? do I need to modify the colours slightly?
