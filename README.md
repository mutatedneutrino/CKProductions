I have never made a website before but I also haven't been doing any true coding in a long long time, so this is going to be a mess of a project history as I slowly cobble together the basics I need for a website and work from there.

Eventually there will be a need for art assets to be uploaded, most of these will be made by me using either Clipstudio or Inkscape. Any exceptions will be listed here.

website hosted through Infomaniak using a Node.js blank project

27/08/25 the website is up! and I'm able to put some simple text on the page that is reflected on the site proper. The next step is to make a more professional looking maintenence screen to a) look compentant and b) feed any users into an upcoming "Salesfirce Digital Experience" project I'll be working on as part of my portfolio. I created the background (/assets/background_site.png) as well as a clean version of the logo and and site icon in #aac6cb (/assets/logo.png and /assets/site icon 2.png) all three made in Inkscape so I can easily test colours
tried to upload background_site.png as the site background but was facing some image loading issues on localhost, tried moving background_site.png to root but no dice, tried a smaller picture (/me.png) and still nothing, will return

28/08/25 there hasn't been time to do any more work on this, but realised i never pushed the work done on 27/08 so pushed today

08/09/25 hoping to start this project back up this week, realsied i never checked the site itself after the push on 28/08, turns out the image upload works fine through git pages! progress will hopefully be made soon
  I came back to this this evening, the background is now working and SHOULD be fixed, no scrolling,  a header logo has been added and favicon is working fine. I did try to add social links to the site, the links work, but I am currently struggling to make them sit where I want them to but it is so very late so I will return next I have the time
    UPCOMING TASKS:
      - move social links to correct location
      - make sure header logo stays centered
      - add centre square for maintenece message
      - make the README.md look a bit better
