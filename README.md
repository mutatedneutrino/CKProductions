<h4>A Website from Scratch</h4>

<i>LinkedIn - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria-dudley/">Victoria Dudley</a></i>
</br>

I have never made a website before but I also haven't been doing any true coding in a long long time, so this is going to be a mess of a project history as I slowly cobble together the basics I need for a website and work from there.
 </br> </br>
There is an excessive amount of deployments, unfortunately anything including images will not load on my local host to test before posting, so you are getting a full view of everything I try
 </br>

Eventually there will be a need for art assets to be uploaded, most of these will be made by me using either Clipstudio or Inkscape. Any exceptions will be listed here.

  <li>LinkedIn icon from <a href="https://brand.linkedin.com/downloads">LinkedIn Brand Guidlines</a></li>
  <li>GitHub icon from <a href="https://github.com/logos">GitHub Logos and Usage</a></li>
  <li>BlueSky icon from <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/press-faq">Bluesky for Journalists</a></li> (I did crop the logo so I had to futz less)
</ul>

    The website is up! I'm able to put some simple text on the page that is reflected on the site proper. The next step is to make a more professional looking maintenance screen to a) look compentant and b) feed any users into an upcoming "Salesforce Digital Experience"       project I'll be working on as part of my portfolio. I created the background (/assets/background_site.png) as well as a clean version of the logo and and site icon in #aac6cb (/assets/logo.png and /assets/site icon 2.png) all three made in Inkscape so I can easily         test colours. 
  </br></br>
    I had a few tries using background_site.png as the site background but was facing some image loading issues on localhost, tried moving background_site.png to root but no dice, tried a smaller picture (/me.png) and still nothing, will return when I have time

    There hasn't been time to do any more work on this, but realised i never pushed the work done on 14/08 so pushed today
 </p>

      Hoping to start this project back up this week, realsied I'd never checked the site itself after the push on 28/08, turns out the image upload works fine through GitHub pages! Progress will hopefully be made soon
      </br></br>
      I came back to this this evening, the background is now working and SHOULD be fixed, no scrolling,  a header logo has been added and favicon is working fine. I did try to add social links to the site, the links work, but I am currently struggling to make them sit          where I want them to but it is so very late so I will return next I have the time
        </br></br>
        <b>UPCOMING TASKS:</b>

              <li><del>move social links to correct location</del></li>
              <li><del>make sure header logo stays centered</del></li>
              <li>add centre square for maintenance message</li>
              <li><del>make the README.md look a bit better</del></li>

      Tidied up the README.md somewhat, I was hoping to colour code some of the test to make a more clear breakdown of my journalling for my dyselxia (large blocks of white on black or vice versa can blur) but alas. This is at least more readable than before
        </br> </br>
      A lot of positional futzing was to be had today, but I've managed to get everything laid out where I relatively want it to be. The styles started to get a bit long so I've moved it into it's own seperate sheet, seems to be working without any additional changes.
        </br></br>
     For this first stage of project I will probably keep everything fixed as is (once the maintenance message is in) while I move onto a Salesforce project temporarily, adding in relevant links as they are created. But I'm excited to see how much of a challenge making        a flexi website is, I gave it a shot and somethings are in the right place but others have just straight vanished! Fun!
       </br></br>
     Unfortunately I cannot continue anymore today
         </br></br>
         <b>UPCOMING TASKS:</b>    
                <ul>
                   <li>WHERE HAS MY LOGO GONE</li>
                   <li>minor fixes on footer and right action tabs</li>
                   <li>add centre square for maintenance message</li>
                   <li>link my Salesforce Dev Org to this site</li>
                   <li>link this site to my Salesforce Dev org</li>
                   <li>redo the logo to match text thickness in heading logo</li>
                   <li>maybe be extra and make a maintenance image - haven't decided</li>
              </ul>

         </br> 
       But there are also some more challenging goals I have that won't be touched until the far future
             </br></br>
             <b>FUTURE VICKI PROBLEMS:</b>    
                <ul>
                   <li>make site work flexibly on multiple screen sizes</li>
                   <li>how hard is it to setup sub pages for projects etc</li>
                   <li>how hard is it to make it compatible with a mobile site</li>
              </ul> 
              </br>
           I may return to these midway through the Salesforce Digital Experience if I want a Dark Souls esque break, but otherwise I should be happy to proceed soon!
