I have never made a website before but I also haven't been doing any true coding in a long long time, so this is going to be a mess of a project history as I slowly cobble together the basics I need for a website and work from there.

Eventually there will be a need for art assets to be uploaded, all of these will be made by me using either Clipstudio or Inkscape
